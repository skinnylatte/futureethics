        <h1>What we believe</h1>
<ol>
<li>Artificial intelligence is one of many tools in our toolkit for crafting software and business</li>
<li>Don't build products for the sake of using AI</li>
<li>When considering the use of AI, ask yourself: do I need it?</li>
<li>What is the end goal? If it is to 'replace people' or 'reduce labor costs completely' instead of 'improving automation' or 'simplifying repetitive tasks', we are not there yet, and we hope we never will</li>
<li>People play a huge role in the growth of, and use of, and potential future success of AI</li>
<li>Generative AI is what's grabbing attention and headlines today. But look past that, and there are plenty of other worthy areas where artificial intelligence can provide value and impact.</li>
<li>Learning about AI and 'upskilling in AI' is just one of the many cyclical changes in the software industry. It's not the only skill to learn.</li>
<li>We want to work on projects where AI is one of several tools in the toolkit, not the projects where you need to implement AI, or else.</li>
