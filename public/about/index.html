        <h1>About us</h1>
<p>We are product managers, researchers academics and executives who want to help you make sense of AI in today's world.</p>
<p>We have experience in startups, academia, government and large organizations.</p>
<p>We got started in 2024, when we saw that there was interest in the use of artificial intelligence to build software and services. However, we were alarmed by the use of AI for the sake of it.</p>
<p>We believe that by abiding by our values, it is possible to consider the use of artificial intelligence in some software and business models. We also believe that the best way to use AI is the best way to use anything: responsibly.</p>
