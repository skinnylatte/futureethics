    <p>Adrianna Tan's work in San Francisco Digital Services, where she established one of the United States' most well-regarded municipal digital services product management teams, shows us how software product management that centers people and usability can make a real difference in our communities. Every product person, even those who work outside of government and the non-profit sector, could learn something from Adrianna.</p>
